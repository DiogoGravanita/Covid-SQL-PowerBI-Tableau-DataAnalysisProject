# Covid Data Analysis and Dashboard Creation Project


## Introduction:


<br/><br/>

## Project Overview

### Data Source

The data set includes all space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission. The file will be added as "space_missions.csv". 

### Objectives

 1. To clean, explore, and analyze space missions data sourced from various reliable sources.

 2. To identify trends and patterns in space missions, including mission success rates, rocket usage, and launch locations.

 3. To create informative visualizations and dashboards using Power BI to present the findings in a clear and engaging manner.

<br/><br/>


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We'll focus on the following KPIs to evaluate the performance and trends of space missions:



1. Total Missions

2. Mission Success Rate

3. Average Mission Cost

4. Countries Involved

<br/><br/>


## Charts and Visualizations:

We'll create a variety of charts and visualizations to present the data effectively:



1. Mission amount by Rocket/Country/Company/Year
2. Average Price by Company
3. Successful Missions by Country/Launch Center/Company
4. Success rate by Country
5. Mission status percentage
6. Average Price by Country/Rocket/Company
7. Total Cost by Year
8. Mission by Rocket Status



<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

## Tools and Technologies:

 - Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for data manipulation and analysis.
 - PowerBI for data visualization and statistical analysis.
 - Obsidian for documentation purposes.

<br/><br/>

## Data cleaning and preparation:
<br/><br/>



### Dividing the Location column:



<br/><br/>



### FIxing Launch Site and Launch center column issues:


<br/><br/>

### Remove useless Column:


<br/><br/>

With the completion of the data cleaning process, our table is now primed for visualization. Despite encountering numerous entries with null values in the "Price" and "Time" columns, we opted to retain them for accurate mission status representation in our graphical analyses. This decision ensures that our visualizations provide a comprehensive view of mission success rates, accounting for all relevant data points. Particularly, since most of the null Price entries will be old entries, then we would be specifically removing many old values and it would greatly affect our accuracy in a negative way when it came to evaluating other dynamics not related to Time and Costs.
